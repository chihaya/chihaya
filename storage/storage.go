// PeerStore is an interface that abstracts the interactions of storing and
// manipulating Peers such that it can be implemented for various data stores.
//
// Implementations of the PeerStore interface must do the following in addition
// to implementing the methods of the interface in the way documented:
//
// - Implement a garbage-collection strategy that ensures stale data is removed.
//     For example, a timestamp on each InfoHash/Peer combination can be used
//     to track the last activity for that Peer. The entire database can then
//     be scanned periodically and too old Peers removed. The intervals and
//     durations involved should be configurable.
// - IPv4 and IPv6 swarms must be isolated from each other.
//     A PeerStore must be able to transparently handle IPv4 and IPv6 Peers, but
//     must separate them. AnnouncePeers and ScrapeSwarm must return information
//     about the Swarm matching the given AddressFamily only.
//
// Implementations can be tested against this interface using the tests in
// storage_tests.go and the benchmarks in storage_bench.go.
